    <p>This will be a paragrpah about me. I'm not quite sure exactly
      what I should write here yet, but hopefully the end product
      will be somewhat eloquent and correctly spelled. If I'm honest,
      coding definitely isn't my strongest suit...or in my top 50 suits.
      It isn't particularly enjoyable to me, and I wonder how emotionally
      traumatized my coding friends might be. I'm too sensitive of a
      person to handle the largely downhill rollercoaster to find much
      worthy payoff in the few moments of satisfaction from finally
      getting a relatively small feature to display properly. Especially
      since that fleeting moment is often sandwiched by the humiliation
      of figuring out you missed a semicolon that would've otherwise
      allowed your code to work an hour ago. I'll happily leave the coding
      to those who are much hardier in emotional nature than myself.
      However, I've been and will continue to try my best to learn, and I
      will whole-heartedly admit that those few instances of genuinely
      figureing something out is actually rather rewarding.
